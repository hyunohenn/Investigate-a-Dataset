## Description

### Introduction
For the final project, I will conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share that documents findings. I' ll take a look at dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I'll use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. 

### Data
The data used for this project is **TMDb movie data** which was cleaned from original data on Kaggle. 

#### Overview and Notes

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
- Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
- There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. 
- The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting

### Why this Project?
In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!
